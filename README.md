# Algorithms-for-Lossy-Data-Compression

The main objective of this thesis is providing an overview of different data compression methods. Currently, information is shared around the globe, even in outerspace, at great rates, and the demmand for more efficient and qualified methods of compressing data is crucial. Making files smaller can represent significant savings in storage and time, being fundamental for the proper behaviour of every computational application. Although lossless methods provide ensured fidelity, their compression rates are not comparable to what can be achieved through lossy methods that take into account probability, redundancy and human perception. This project aims to present some of the compression lossy methods used nowadays such as Haar transform, Fourier transform and Low rank matrix approximation, and how they can be implemented in image compression.   

# The Project

This project contains 2 files containing the codes of the implementation of Image Compression using SVD and Haar Transform in Python, along with a PDF file with the information of the whole project and the explanation of each of the methods.
